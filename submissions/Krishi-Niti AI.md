## Project Description    
### Krishi Niti AI is a smart, AI-powered agriculture assistant that helps farmers make data-driven decisions through crop recommendations, disease detection, and personalized advisory ‚Äî built fully in Next.js and powered by Gemini AI, IoT sensors, and Appwrite for backend services.
### Problem - Farmers today face challenges like uncertain weather, poor soil awareness, and lack of timely advice.
Krishi Niti AI bridges this gap with a centralized platform that connects IoT-based farm sensors, AI-driven insights, and market data to empower farmers with real-time, localized, and sustainable solutions.

The project I created is...
-->
üß† AI-Powered Advisory
- Uses Gemini AI APIs for personalized crop and soil suggestions.
- Supports multilingual chat and voice interaction for regional accessibility.
- Context-aware chatbot trained with farmer data (soil, weather, crop type).

üåø Crop Disease Detection
Farmers can upload an image of their crop.
- The system uses Gemini‚Äôs image analysis model to detect diseases.
- Returns a structured JSON response with:
- Detected disease name
- Severity level
- Possible causes
- Treatment & prevention tips

üå¶Ô∏è IoT Integration (Our platform support IOT devices)
Optional support for real-time farm monitoring using:
- Soil Moisture Sensor (YL-69)
- Soil pH Sensor
- DHT11 Sensor for temperature & humidity
- Data auto-synced to Appwrite backend for analysis.

üìä Yield Prediction & Crop Recommendation
- Uses soil health, satellite, and weather data to predict yield.
- Suggests profitable crops based on location and market demand.

üè™ Marketplace Integration
- Displays real-time mandi prices and trends.
- Helps farmers plan crops with better profitability.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
### As a son of a farmer, I witnessed how many farmers lack timely, personalized farming guidance and rely on manual judgment. The idea for Krishi Niti AI came from the need to bridge this gap using technology. By combining AI, IoT, and real-time data, the project aims to help farmers make informed decisions about soil health, crop selection, and disease prevention‚Äîturning traditional farming into smart, data-driven agriculture.
